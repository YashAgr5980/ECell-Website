The Official Website of Entrepreneurial Club of The LNM Institute of Technology, Jaipur.

The E cell LNMIIT for Entrepreneurship is an interdisciplinary centre for research, teaching and skilled manpower development in the field of entrepreneurship.
It  believes in a meaningful entrepreneurial community can only thrive when the entire scope of the academic enterprise is located in close proximity, in order to foster the formal and informal intercommunications that lead to productive collaboration.
The mission of the Centre is to emerge as a leading Centre in the region facilitating interactions among students, researchers and faculty from India  and abroad in encouraging entrepreneurship.

It is a non profit organization which aims at developing an entrepreneurial spirit amongst the students by supporting and developing their entrepreneurship skills.

Is is developed and being maintained by me, and I would love to see some great Web Developers over the Globe, read the code and fix some issues in the website.
